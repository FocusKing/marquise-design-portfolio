# marquise-design-portfolio

## Description

In this project we create a web application from scratch.  Building a portfolio page to add to my arsenal of projects.   Utilizing skills we used such as flexbox, media queries and css variable to meet the Acceptance Criteria. 
I added semantic values to the tags within the HTML file, so that our own site is optimized for search engines.
