## Tests

As an employee completing the assignment given by a marketing agency
I created  a codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that our own site is optimized for search engines.
I utilized Live Server to see instant changes as I made entries into the portal.  
Testing to make sure the things I input were entered correctly and that the site still operated properly.
